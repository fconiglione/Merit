# Merit - Student Result Management System

Welcome to Merit, a comprehensive student result management system designed with you (the user) in mind.

## About the App

Merit is an intuitive student result management system that offers a full suite of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features. It’s designed to be user-friendly and highly efficient, with a home page, students page, courses page, and results page where you can easily add, edit, update, or delete data.

While the app currently has several buttons that are not yet functional, they may be added in future commits to the project. You can check out the frontend of the Merit app by clicking [here](https://merit-srms.vercel.app/), but please note that due to hosting limitations, CRUD or data functionality is not available at this time.
